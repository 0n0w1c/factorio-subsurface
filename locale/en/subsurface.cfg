[item-name]
rock-explosives=Rock explosives

[item-description]
item-elevator-input=Place this on your oversurface to connect it with the underground. Beware that the place in the underground has to be exposed and must be free.
item-elevator-output=Place this on your oversurface to connect it with the underground. Beware that the place in the underground has to be exposed and must be free.
fluid-elevator-input=Place this on your oversurface to connect it with the underground. Beware that the place in the underground has to be exposed and must be free.
fluid-elevator-output=Place this on your oversurface to connect it with the underground. Beware that the place in the underground has to be exposed and must be free.
active-air-vent=The active air vent moves pollution bottom-up, but needs electicity to run.
air-vent=The passive air vent just equalizes pollution between both surfaces. If the oversurface is more polluted it will diffuse to the underground, so make sure there is enough space for it to dissipate. It doesn't need electricity to run.

[entity-description]
tunnel-entrance-cable=Step down into the darkness of your planet! Press __CONTROL__toggle-driving__, but beware pollution and the missing daylight.
tunnel-exit-cable=Climb up into daylight! Press __CONTROL__toggle-driving__ to breathe fresh air and see daylight again.
surface-drill=Make sure the excavated material is disposed of and wait and see what happens.\n[font=default-bold][color=yellow]Beware that once the entrance is digged, it can't be removed anymore.[/color][/font]
prospector=Prospects resources in the lower subsurface in a circular area with a radius of 6 chunks.

[subsurface]
cannot-place-here=Subsurface is not exposed or occupied at this position
suffocation=You are suffocating because there is too much pollution in here!
limit-reached=The allowed limit of subsurfaces is reached!
miner-inventory-full=Miner's inventory is full. It won't move until it is cleared.
miner-stuck=Miner is stuck. It must be unstuck manually.

[mod-setting-description]
pollution-trains=Enable this for harder challenge of handling underground trains
pollution-trains-excludes=Enter all prototype names of locomotives you don't want to cause pollution (electric locomotives). Comma-separated list.
subsurface-limit=Number of maximum available subsurfaces.\nChanging this setting while deeper subsurfaces exist does NOT delete them.
