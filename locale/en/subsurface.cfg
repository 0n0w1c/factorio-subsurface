[item-description]
item-elevator-input=Place this on your oversurface to connect it with the underground. Beware that the place in the underground has to be exposed and must be free.
item-elevator-output=Place this on your oversurface to connect it with the underground. Beware that the place in the underground has to be exposed and must be free.
fluid-elevator-input=Place this on your oversurface to connect it with the underground. Beware that the place in the underground has to be exposed and must be free.
fluid-elevator-output=Place this on your oversurface to connect it with the underground. Beware that the place in the underground has to be exposed and must be free.
active-air-vent=The active air vent moves pollution bottom-up, but needs electicity to run.
air-vent=The passive air vent just equalizes pollution between both surfaces. If the oversurface is more polluted it will diffuse to the underground, so make sure there is enough space for it to dissipate. It doesn't need electricity to run.

tunnel-entrance-cable=Step down into the darkness of your planet! Press __CONTROL__toggle-driving__, but beware pollution and the missing daylight.
tunnel-exit-cable=Climb up into daylight! Press __CONTROL__toggle-driving__ to breathe fresh air and see daylight again.
surface-driller=Make sure the excavated material is disposed of and wait and see what happens.

[subsurface]
cannot-place-here=Subsurface is not exposed or occupied at this position
