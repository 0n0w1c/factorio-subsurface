Version: 1.0.3
  Features:
    - AAI miners can now dig automatically (but still now very good). They stop if their inventory is full
    - Number of subsurfaces can now be limited
  Changes:
    - Subsurfaces now adopt radius from Space Exploration planets
    - Locomotive pollution is now disableable
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash when mods add locomotives without burner prototype
    - Fixed crash when mods add new cliffs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
  Features:
    - Map limits are now adopted to subsurfaces
    - Players suffocate if there is too much pollution
    - Locomotives now produce pollution (not only in the underground)
    - There is a small light cone beneath air vents
    - Pinging locations into chat (Ctrl+Alt+Left mouse by default) also pings these locations in the subsurface and oversurface to mark building positions
  Changes:
    - Air vents are less effective in deeper subsurfaces
    - Rocket silos can't be placed in subsurfaces (of course!)
    - Subsurface walls now look like rocks and areas are exposed in a circular shape
    - Cliff explosives can be thrown even when there are no cliffs near, because they can be used to blow away subsurface walls
